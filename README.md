My solutions for Advent of Code 2021: https://adventofcode.com/2021

Each solution consists of one file in the root folder, its name consisting of the day for the problem.

`fetch_input.py` is a helper file that fetches and saves an input file when run. It requires a `.env` file to be created, which includes one field `AOC_SESSION`: the cookie session for fetching Advent of Code input. To run the file, please first install the necessary packages in `requirements.txt`.
